## Mapping Interface

### How to use:

Include this script in whatever page needs a map, along with these:
<script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyB0hzC85PcofCh0luuo5By7JgublOMvWds&callback=initMap"></script>


You can add a marker to the map using the "addMarker" function. Provide it a js object containing a lat (latitude) and a lng (longitude) variable, and a string containing the html that should be in the infoWindow.

*WIP* I'm working on a helper function to make the HTML for the infoWindow. Having trouble styling it.
